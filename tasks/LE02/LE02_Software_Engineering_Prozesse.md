## Artifacts

List of artifacts that should be made before the start of the project.

- Vision of the product
- Tech Stack

## Reasoning

The customer is still pretty undecided and they don’t yet know what they really want. So an agile approach would be the smarter choice. That would then allow us to implement those new decisions quickly. The small team size would also point more towards an agile method.

### Zühlke Chart

| Parameter   | Value               | Reasoning                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Size        | 3                   | Startups usually don’t have a lot of people. And they planned it with about 3 developers in mind. |
| Criticality | Discretionary money | Auctions do involve money, but since its more for smaller companies it wont be that much |
| Team Skills | 50%  / 50%          | Just an assumption as there is no information about the team |
| Change      | 25%                 | The vision and the requirements are in disagreement so its likely that many, if not all, requirements will change |
| Culture     | 70%                 | Just an assumption as there is no information about the team |

The Zühlke chart gives you an idea of what project management methodology you could use but never really gives you an absolute answer.

## Conclusion

In short an agile framework should be used since requirements will change and there are only 3 developers in this team. I would use Scrum since I don’t know the other frameworks very well and the team isn’t big enough for XP to be advantageous.
